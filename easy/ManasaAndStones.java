        Q: How can you come to this conclusion so fast. I was trying to calculate all permutations of (a,b) in the number of n-1 slots

        Great question ‚Äî and it's a very natural initial instinct to think of all permutations of a and b in n-1 slots, because it sounds like a problem about combinations or permutations.

        But here‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt need to generate all permutations, and how we arrive at a faster, simpler approach:

        üîπ Let's break it down:

        You start with a value of 0 and make n - 1 jumps.
        Each jump can be of size a or size b.

        So your final value is simply:

        final_value = (number_of_a_jumps * a) + (number_of_b_jumps * b)


        And since:

        number_of_a_jumps + number_of_b_jumps = n - 1


        You can rewrite the equation as:

        final_value = i * a + (n - 1 - i) * b   where i = 0 to n - 1


        So all you're doing is looping i from 0 to n-1, which represents all possible counts of how many times you chose a, and the rest are b. This covers all distinct combinations, not permutations.

        üî∏ Why permutations aren't needed

        Imagine:

        n = 4 (so 3 steps),

        a = 10, b = 100

        The permutations of a and b across 3 steps would include:

        a a a ‚Üí 30
        a a b ‚Üí 120
        a b a ‚Üí 120
        b a a ‚Üí 120
        ...


        But look: even though there are multiple permutations, they all lead to the same final value ‚Äî because the order doesn't matter, just the count of how many times a and b were used.

        This is the key realization:

        ‚ùó Only the number of times each step value is used matters, not the order.

        üîπ So the approach becomes:

        Just loop over how many times a is chosen (from 0 to n - 1), calculate the total for that combination, and store it in a set to avoid duplicates (in case a == b).

        üîπ Summary of insights:
        Approach	Time Complexity	Reason it's not needed
        All permutations	O(2^(n-1))	Explodes quickly, redundant results
        All combinations (counts)	O(n)	Fast, gives all unique outcomes
        Optimal logic	O(n log n)	(with sort), efficient and simple

        Let me know if you‚Äôd like a visualization or a version of this in Python, C++, or any other language.
